    <label for=""> Before The cyclone season</label>
    <ul>
        <li>You should find out if your home, school, workplace, or other frequently visited locations are in tsunami
            hazard areas along sea-shore.</li>
        <li>Know the height of your street above sea level and the distance of your street from the coast or other
            high-risk waters. (Local administration may put sign boards).</li>
        <li>Plan evacuation routes from your home, school, workplace, or any other place you could be where tsunamis
            present a risk.</li>
        <li>If your children's school is in an identified inundation zone, find out what the school evacuation plan is.
        </li>
        <li>Use a Weather Radio or stay tuned to a local radio or television station to keep informed of local watches
            and warnings.</li>
        <li>Talk to your insurance agent.Homeowners' policies may not cover flooding from a tsunami. Ask the Insurance
            Agent about the benefits from Multi-Hazard Insurance Schemes.</li>
        <li>Discuss tsunamis with your family.Everyone should know what to do in a tsunami situation. Discussing
            tsunamis ahead of time will help reduce fear and save precious time in an emergency. Review flood safety and
            preparedness measures with your family.</li>

    <h3>If you are in an area at risk from tsunamis</h3>


    <ul>
        <li>You should find out if your home, school, workplace, or other frequently visited locations are in tsunami
            hazard areas.</li>
        <li>Know the height of your street above sea level and the distance of your street from the coast or other
            high-risk waters. (Local administration may put sign boards). Also find out the height above sea level and
            the distance from the coast of outbuildings that house animals, as well as pastures or corrals.</li>
        <li>Plan evacuation routes from your home, school, workplace, or any other place you could be where tsunamis
            present a risk. If possible, pick areas (30 meters) above sea level or go as far as 3 kilometres inland,
            away from the coastline. If you cannot get this high or far, go as high or far as you can. Every meter
            inland or upward may make a difference. You should be able to reach your safe location on foot within 15
            minutes. After a disaster, roads may become blocked or unusable. Be prepared to evacuate by foot if
            necessary. Footpaths normally lead uphill and inland, while many roads parallel coastlines. Follow posted
            tsunami evacuation routes; these will lead to safety. Local emergency management officials can advise you on
            the best route to safety and likely shelter locations.</li>
        <li>If your children's school is in an identified inundation zone, find out what the school evacuation plan is.
            Find out if the plan requires you to pick your children up from school or from another location. Telephone
            lines during a tsunami watch or warning may be overloaded and routes to and from schools may be jammed.</li>
        <li>Practice your evacuation routes. Familiarity may save your life. Be able to follow your escape route at
            night and during inclement weather. Practicing your plan makes the appropriate response more of a reaction,
            requiring less thinking during an actual emergency situation.</li>
        <li>Use a Weather Radio or stay tuned to a local radio or television station to keep informed of local watches
            and warnings.</li>
        <li>Talk to your insurance agent.Homeowners' policies may not cover flooding from a tsunami. Ask the Insurance
            Agent about the benefits from Multi-Hazard Insurance Schemes.</li>
        <li>Discuss tsunamis with your family. Everyone should know what to do in a tsunami situation. Discussing
            tsunamis ahead of time will help reduce fear and save precious time in an emergency. Review flood safety and
            preparedness measures with your family.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3> When cyclone starts</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Listen to the radio (All India Radio stations give weather warnings).</li>
        <li>Keep monitoring the warnings. This will help you prepare for a cyclone emergency.</li>
        <li>Pass the information to others.</li>
        <li>Ignore rumours and do not spread them; this will help to avoid panic situations.</li>
        <li>Believe in the official information</li>
        <li>When a cyclone alert is on for your area continue normal working but stay alert to the radio warnings.</li>
        <li>Stay alert for the next 24 hours as a cyclone alert means that the danger is within 24 hours.</li>
    </ul>


    

   <h3>If you are visiting an area at risk from tsunamis</h3>

    <ul>
        
        <li>Check with the hotel or campground operators for tsunami evacuation information and find out what the warning system is for tsunamis. It is important to know designated escape routes before a warning is issued.</li>
        <li>One of the early warning signals of a tsunami is that the sea water recedes several metres, exposing fish on shallow waters or on the beaches. If you see the sea water receding, you must immediately leave the beach and go to higher ground far away from the beach.
        Protect Your Property</li>
        <li>You should avoid building or living in buildings within 200 meters of the high tide coastline.</li>
        <li>Make a list of items to bring inside in the event of a tsunami.</li>
        <li>Elevate coastal homes.</li>
        <li>Have an engineer check your home and advise about ways to make it more resistant to tsunami water.</li>
        <li>There may be ways to divert waves away from your property. Improperly built walls could make your situation worse. Consult with a professional for advice.</li>
        <li>Ensure that any outbuildings, pastures, or corrals are protected in the same way as your home. When installing or changing fence lines, consider placing them in such a way that your animals are able to move to higher ground in the event of a tsunami.</li>
       
    </ul>


<h3>If you are at the beach or near the ocean and you feel the earth shake:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Move immediately to higher ground, DO NOT wait for a tsunami warning to be announced. Stay away from rivers and streams that lead to the ocean as you would stay away from the beach and ocean if there is a tsunami. A regional tsunami from a local earthquake could strike some areas before a tsunami warning could be announced.</li>
    <li>Tsunamis generated in distant locations will generally give people enough time to move to higher ground. For locally-generated tsunamis, where you might feel the ground shake, you may only have a few minutes to move to higher ground.</li>
    <li>High, multi-storied, reinforced concrete hotels are located in many low-lying coastal areas. The upper floors of these hotels can provide a safe place to find refuge should there be a tsunami warning and you cannot move quickly inland to higher ground.
    </li>
    <li>Offshore reefs and shallow areas may help break the force of tsunami waves, but large and dangerous wave can still be a threat to coastal residents in these areas.</li>
    <li>Staying away from all low-lying areas is the safest advice when there is a tsunami warning.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What to do after a Tsunami</h3>

<ul>

    <li>The Tsunami may have damaged roads, bridges, or other places that may be unsafe.</li>
    <li>Check yourself for injuries and get first aid if necessary before helping injured or trapped persons.</li>
    <li>If someone needs to be rescued, call professionals with the right equipment to help.</li>
    <li>Avoid disaster areas.</li>
    <li>Check food supplies.</li>
</ul>
